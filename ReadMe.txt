The three pages that are working Are:

	Index.html,

OurMission.html 

	and
ContactUs.html

The links between all three pages work just fine so begin 
with any page.

There is just a single file uploaded into the folder so that there is
downloadable content. 
I didn't want too much data making the site too big to upload 
onto the UOP server.

Turns out I did week five's assignment this week but we'll see 
how my grade goes on this one and I will update my site as needed for 
the final.

              Hope you like it!
